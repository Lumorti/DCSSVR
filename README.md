# DCSSVR

A VR port of the open-source dungeon crawler [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/). This works by running a seperate instance of the ASCII version of the game, then using that output to generate the 3D world. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Lumorti/DCSSVR/releases).

Please submit bug reports from the settings menu and I'll get around to fixing them whenever I get a chance. Pull requests and suggestions are of course also welcome. Debug mode can be enabled from the settings if you want to cheat and/or test things.

There's also an experimental APK for Quest, but this requires you to run a server (i.e. "server.exe" or "server.sh") on a device on the same network. This hasn't been tested as much as the desktop VR version, and the server can be somewhat unreliable. The server is needed since Quest doesn't allow running Crawl as a subprocess like on Windows.
